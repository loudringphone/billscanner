### Day 1

I'm currently planning to create a bill scanner app using React Native, which will utilize image-to-text recognition and AI technology to automatically categorise the bills. As part of the project, I'm learning how to capture images using the phone's camera and retrieve images from the device's gallery. This will enable users to easily scan their bills and have the application process the information for categorisation and organisation.

### Day2

Today, as I continued my planning for the app, I remained acutely aware of the primary concern users might have regarding the sharing of sensitive financial information. It is understandable that users may hesitate to use the app for business use or tax return purposes, fearing that their personal invoices might be accessible to me as the developer. To alleviate these valid concerns, I have made a deliberate and crucial decision: the app will be designed exclusively for tracking and managing grocery expenses. By focusing solely on grocery shopping, I aim to assure users that their sensitive financial data will remain completely secure and inaccessible to anyone, including myself.

I identified 14 essential spending categories to enable users to efficiently organize their purchases. The categories include Fruits and Vegetables, Meat and Seafood, Dairy and Eggs, Bakery and Bread, Canned and Packaged Goods, Grains and Pasta, Snacks and Sweets, Beverages, Frozen Foods, Condiments and Spices, Cleaning Supplies, Personal Care, Pet Supplies, and a catch-all category named "Other".

By narrowing the app's scope to grocery tracking, I aim to deliver a specialized tool that simplifies users' shopping experience. The next steps will involve designing an intuitive user interface and determining the technology stack for development.

## Day 3

While I initially found the transition to React Native challenging, I've come to realize that it's an exciting opportunity to learn and grow. The need to create sign-up screens for user registration pushed me to explore new packages and techniques specific to React Native.

Despite the initial learning curve, I was able to find a great solution: the '@react-navigation/stack' package. Learning how to navigate between screens using this package has been incredibly valuable, and it has made the navigation process much smoother for my app.

I'm excited about the progress I've made so far, and I'm enjoying the journey of learning new things in React Native. It's a rewarding experience to see my skills expand, and I'm looking forward to integrating AWS authentication to provide users with an even better experience.
